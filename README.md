# To Eat List API ðŸ¦‘ðŸ¥’ðŸ¥¢

## Setup

Setup and serve
```BASH
pipenv install
```
Enter the shell
```BASH
pipenv shell
```
Run server
Serve app
```BASH
flask run  
```
When updating the python version it is advised to run 
```BASH
pipenv --rm  
```
and 
```BASH
pipenv install
```
again otherwise the python version won't update in the existing environment...

## Deployment
### Deploy to Heroku
The API is deployed to Heroku  
Before you can deploy to heroku add the following files: 
- [Procfile](./Procfile)
- [runtime.txt](./runtime.txt)

Then:
```BASH
heroku login    
```
if you haven't yet
```BASH
 heroku create <app_name>
```
or 
```BASH
 heroku git:remote -a <existing_app>
```
finally
```BASH
git push heroku master
```

### Setup Postgres DB on Heroku
Although this would not be ideal for a scalable service, but for now we can setup a DB manually,when you run:
```BASH
heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```
Heroku automatically defines the `DATABASE_URL` env varible for the new postgres db.
We needed to install the following packages in our project:
`marshmallow-sqlalchemy = "*"`
`psycopg2-binary`

After `git push heroku master`, run the create command:
```BASH
heroku run flask db_create
```

If needed, connect to the the `production` db in your terminal by changing the env varible `DATABASE_URL` to this connection URL:

```
heroku pg:credentials:url DATABASE
```

## Useful for poking sqlite db from CLI
You can run queries in the command line by
Opening a console
```BASH
sqlite3 <db/file/path>
```
show tables
```SQL
.tables
```

run some query 
```SQL
select * from users;
```
exit -> `crtl+D`
